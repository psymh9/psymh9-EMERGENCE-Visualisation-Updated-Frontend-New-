# Front-End Repository

This is the GitHub repository for the EMERGENCE network visualisation tool front-end 
which includes a website on which the tool will be hosted and embedded into the main
EMERGENCE website for easy access for users.

The front-end web portion of the application will be developed using the django python 
web framework in order to implement and host the website with the back-end network
visualisation tool embedded into it for use by the end-users.
